# Action.Execute

**Works in:** Teams · Copilot · Outlook

Gathers input values, merges them with the `data` property if specified, and sends them to the Bot via an Invoke activity. The Bot can respond synchronously and return an updated Adaptive Card to be displayed by the client. `Action.Execute` works in all Adaptive Card hosts.

`Action.Execute` allows you to create scenarios that will work across Teams, Copilot and Outlook. Use `Action.Execute` in place of `Action.Submit` if you are targeting Microsoft applications other than just Teams.

See **Universal Actions for Adaptive Cards** for more details.

## Schema

| `type` | `string` | — | Must be `Action.Execute`. | 1.0 |
| `verb` | `string` | — | The verb of the action. | 1.4 |
| `associatedInputs` | `string` | — | The Ids of the inputs associated with the `Action.Submit`. When the action is executed, the values of the associated inputs are sent to the Bot. See **Input validation** for more details.<br>Valid values: `"auto"`, `"none"`. | 1.3 |
| `behavior` | `string` | `"Default"` | **Preview.** Controls the behavior of the action. When set to Toggle, the action acts as a toggle that alternates between the normal and toggled states each time it's executed.<br>Valid values: `"Default"`, `"Toggle"`. | 1.5 |

| `data` | `string` or `object` | — | The data to send to the Bot when the action is executed. When expressed as an object, `data` is sent back to the Bot when the action is executed, adorned with the values of the inputs expressed as key/value pairs, where the key is the Id of the input. If `data` is expressed as a string, input values are not sent to the Bot.<br>Valid values: `SubmitActionData`. | 1.0 |
| `fallback` | `object` or `string` | — | An alternate action to render if the type of this one is unsupported or if the host application doesn't support all the capabilities specified in the `requires` property.<br>Valid values: `Action.Submit`, `Action.OpenUrl`, `Action.Execute`, `Action.ToggleVisibility`, `Action.ShowCard`, `Action.ResetInputs`, `Action.Popover`, `Action.OpenUrlDialog`, `Action.InsertImage`, `Action.RunCommands`, `"drop"`. | 1.2 |
| `iconUrl` | `string` | — | A URL (or Base64-encoded Data URI) to a PNG, GIF, JPEG or SVG image to be displayed on the left of the action's title.<br>`iconUrl` also accepts the `icon:<icon-name>[,regular\|filled]` format to display an icon from the Adaptive Card icon catalog instead of an image. For example, use `icon:Calendar` for the regular style or `icon:Calendar,filled` for the filled style. | 1.1 |
